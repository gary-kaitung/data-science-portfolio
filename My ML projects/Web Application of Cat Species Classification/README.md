# Cat species classification model using fastai on Render#

This repo showed my first project using fastai to classify images among cat species.

The dataset was created using 500 images downloaded from Google Images to train on 6 different cat species. (tiger, lion, leopard, jaguar, cheetab, cat)

Resnet34 was used as the transfer learning DL model during training.

Take a look and try it out!
