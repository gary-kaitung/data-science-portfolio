	- [autonomous-driving-object-detection-YOLO-model](https://github.com/gary-kaitung/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/autonomous-driving-object-detection-YOLO-model/Autonomous%20driving%20application-Car%20detection.ipynb): Using YOLO model to detect car and object for autonomous driving. Build a car detection system to recogniza 80 classes by using front camera mounted on the car. 
Reference paper: Redmon et al., 2016 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640) and Redmon and Farhadi, 2016 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08242).
